I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\n\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\n\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\n\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\n\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\n\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.", 'I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\n\n## General-purpose models\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF). Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux. \n- **7B:** [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM.\n- **10.7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF). Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it\'s slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\n\n## Roleplay models\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven\'t tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can\'t vouch for it.\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), my favorite model for roleplaying if I have the resources to run it. It\'s a bit of a behemoth but has the same requirements as Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO.\n\nAnd some extra information, while I\'m at it:\n\n## Frontends\nI alternate between using:\n\n- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). Terminal client. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it [lags behind upstream llama.cpp](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/1825).\n- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Upstream project, minimal overhead, pretty CLI-heavy. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone.\n- [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) connected to [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), usually if I\'m using a model hosted from another PC, want to do a roleplay, or use its built-in RAG capability (vector storage).\n\n## Settings\n- For general chatting, I have my settings set to Min P at 0.1 (0.01 for 8x7B models) and temperature at 1.0.\n- For roleplaying, I can lower the min P to 0.05 (0.001 for 8x7B models) and/or set the "smoothing" value (quadratic sampling) to 0.23, occasionally raising the temperature and toying with it being first or last in the sampler order.', "Midnight-Miqu-103B-v1.0 for creative writing, it's noticeably more intelligent then even the best 70B models.", '### Use case:\n\nRoleplay chatting with character cards. Small models.\n\nI mostly look for strong character card adherence, system prompt following, response formatting, general coherence and models that will just go along with the most hardcore NSFW roleplay without resistance.\n\nRecommendations are always welcome.\n\n  - Backend: KoboldCpp (`--contextsize 8192`)\n  - Frontend: SillyTavern\n\n---\n\n### Models:\n\n1) InfinityRP (7B)\n\nAn overall great model with solid character following and great response formatting. Seems to know not to write/speak for the {{user}} and when to stop.\n\n"This model was basically made to stop some upsetting hallucinations, so {{char}} mostly and occasionally will wait {{user}} response instead of responding itself or deciding for {{user}}, also, my primary idea was to create a cozy model that thinks."\n\n  - Model: [Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B](https://huggingface.co/Endevor/InfinityRP-v1-7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/InfinityRP-v1-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n2) BuRP (7B)\n\nSimilar to the above, but with more unalignment. Generally also pretty solid with a slightly different style you might like compared to the original InfinityRP.\n\nThe model card feels like a personal *attack* on my formatting complaints and I can respect that.\n\n"So you want a model that can do it all? You\'ve been dying to RP with a superintelligence who never refuses your advances while sticking to your strange and oddly specific dialogue format? Well, look no further because BuRP is the model you need."\n\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n3) Layris (9B)\n\nThis passthrough Eris merge aimed to bring a high scoring model together with Layla-V4. It has shown to be smart and unaligned. Also a good option in this parameter size for our use case.\n\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B/)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n4) Infinitely-Laydiculous (7B)\n\nI really like InfinityRP\'s style, and wanted to see it merged with Layla-V4 for her absolute unhingedness/unalignment.\n\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n5) Kunoichi-DPO-v2 (7B)\n\nGreat all around choice. Widely recommended by many users. Punches above what you\'d expect.\n\n  - Model: [SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n6) Layla-V4 (7B)\n\nThis model has been stripped out of all refusals. A truly based and unaligned breed that is solid for roleplaying. A NSFW natural.\n\n[I highly recommend you read this post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1b3jj0v)\n\n  - Model: [l3utterfly/mistral-7b-v0.1-layla-v4](https://huggingface.co/l3utterfly/mistral-7b-v0.1-layla-v4/)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/mistral-7b-v0.1-layla-v4-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/mistral-7b-v0.1-layla-v4-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n7) Kunocchini (128k-test) (7B)\n\nKunoichi-DPO-v2 with better handling of longer contexts.\n\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Kunocchini-7b-128k-test](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Kunocchini-7b-128k-test)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Kunocchini-7b-128k-test-GGUF-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Kunocchini-7b-128k-test-GGUF-Imatrix)', "I'm obviously partial, but I've been running [wolfram/miquliz-120b-v2.0](https://huggingface.co/wolfram/miquliz-120b-v2.0) almost exclusively since making it.

I have the unified RAM to run bigger models, but on principle I prefer parallel use of small models, and this one is just solid for almost any purpose I've tried. Most of my applications are chat-driven."]}, {'title': 'I have been coding with Mixtral everyday it has saved me days of work.', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1biay4h/i_have_been_coding_with_mixtral_everyday_it_has/', 'comments': ['Using AI to handle boring work has made me realise how much code is just boilerplate', 'Which model specifically, and quantizing amount? context window size?', "i'm in the process of learning Python and LLMs have been SO important for this, i'm convinced they've made it 10x easier. they are very good at answering the dumb/easy questions and debugging silly mistakes, which is a huge time-saver when you're new to a language. i would bet within the next few years, every serious enterprise is going to have LLM tools with context large enough to include their entire codebase and it's going to be the go-to for juniors with questions about basic functionality. it's so insanely useful and saves so much time.", 'One goal of mine is to create an interface for an LLM with a graphical flow chart tool, the interface changes the flowchart objects to prompts, the LLM turns it to code. \n\nThen make it so the LLM can draw boxes. \n\nSelf training AI unleashed. 🌝', "\\- Don't ask AI to write entire projects for you, end to end.\n\n\\-  Ask it for the equivalent of a pizza base, which you can then add individual ingredients to yourself.\n\nWhen I try and ask a language model to create a tesselating hexagonal grid, none of them can do it.  Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\n\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\n\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\n\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.  It has an unfortunate tendency to cause intense, migraine induced vomiting, and psychotic breakdowns.", 'What is the tests? Is that prompt works? Can you describe it more specifically?', 'I have been toying with fined tuned variations of Mixtral and Codellama 38B to power GPT-Pilot locally.

I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\n\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\n\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\n\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\n\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.

Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF).

Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it\'s slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\n\n## Roleplay models\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven\'t tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can\'t vouch for it.\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), my favorite model for roleplaying if I have the resources to run it.

Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\n\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\n\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\n\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.

I'm as fascinated as anyone by the possibilities of how this stuff could change our world, and it is super-exciting to watch this technology evolve into a way that anyone at home could have it - it's like unboxing your first Commodore 64 all over again.\n\nBut nothing has moved technology along like our base human desires, and I am human too.\n\n**Westlake-10.7B-v2** is the newcomer to the dirty games and fits in as little as 8GB.  Almost anyone with a mid-spec gaming rig can run this well and get their fix, and competes very well with the classic 70B+ models, which is nothing short of amazing.  You could stop here and just get this one and you will leave this thread happy.\n\nAnything with Noromaid in it is a staple of rip your clothes off style raunch, a few flavors are worth mentioning.  **Noromaid 20B, EstopianMaid 13B, Noromaid-0.4-Mixtral-8x7B-ZLoss**, and the new **MiquMaid** variants will do their worst to you with even the slightest suggestion.\n\nFor a more intelligent good time with a slower burn, and if you have lots of VRAM (48GB recommended), consider **Midnight-Rose** or **Midnight-Miqu** (less smutty and more smutty, respectively), in their 70B or 103B forms.  Even at small quants, IQ2 or IQ3, they write very well, just be a little more patient.  They'll run very well on 2x RTX 3090s.\n\nAnd whatever you do, don't reply with anything else that might arouse, titillate, or seduce someone into taking an imaginary partner or thirty into their own hand.", 'I test models on a wide range of devices, so I have several favorites depending on the size.\n\n## General-purpose models\n- **1.1B:** [TinyDolphin 2.8 1.1B](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/TinyDolphin-2.8-1.1b-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~700MB RAM and tested on my Pi 4 with 2 gigs of RAM. Hallucinates a lot, but works for basic conversation.\n- **2.7B:** [Dolphin 2.6 Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF). Takes over ~2GB RAM and tested on my 3GB 32-bit phone via llama.cpp on Termux. \n- **7B:** [Nous Hermes Mistral 7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/Crataco/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-imatrix-GGUF). Takes about ~4-5GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my laptop with 8GB RAM.\n- **10.7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 SOLAR 10.7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B-GGUF). Takes about ~6-8GB RAM depending on context length. Works on my server PCs and my primary PC (16GB RAM, 4GB VRAM).\n- **8x7B:** [Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-i1-GGUF). At IQ3_S it can run on a laptop with 16GB RAM and 8GB VRAM with 10-11 layers offloaded at 4096 ctx, but I recall it\'s slightly slower than Q3_K_S (which I had a more consistent ~4.4 tokens/sec with).\n\n## Roleplay models\n- **7B:** [Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF) is my most reliable, but I **love** [Erosumika](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Erosumika-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix), which sacrifices the logical yet synthetic GPT dataset for something more organic, similar to older models like Noromaid, Pygmalion 6B, and AI Dungeon 2.\n- **10.7B:** [Fimbulvetr-11B-v2](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Fimbulvetr-11B-v2-i1-GGUF). I haven\'t tested it nearly as much as Kunoichi, so I can\'t vouch for it.\n- **8x7B:** [BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/ycros/BagelMIsteryTour-v2-8x7B-GGUF), my favorite model for roleplaying if I have the resources to run it. It\'s a bit of a behemoth but has the same requirements as Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral 8x7B DPO.\n\nAnd some extra information, while I\'m at it:\n\n## Frontends\nI alternate between using:\n\n- [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama). Terminal client. Automatically offloads GPU layers, easy to download and get a model running, etc. But it [lags behind upstream llama.cpp](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/1825).\n- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Upstream project, minimal overhead, pretty CLI-heavy. With cmake, I was able to compile the latest commit (c47cf41) on my 32-bit Android phone.\n- [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) connected to [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), usually if I\'m using a model hosted from another PC, want to do a roleplay, or use its built-in RAG capability (vector storage).\n\n## Settings\n- For general chatting, I have my settings set to Min P at 0.1 (0.01 for 8x7B models) and temperature at 1.0.\n- For roleplaying, I can lower the min P to 0.05 (0.001 for 8x7B models) and/or set the "smoothing" value (quadratic sampling) to 0.23, occasionally raising the temperature and toying with it being first or last in the sampler order.', "Midnight-Miqu-103B-v1.0 for creative writing, it's noticeably more intelligent then even the best 70B models.", '### Use case:\n\nRoleplay chatting with character cards.

Generally also pretty solid with a slightly different style you might like compared to the original InfinityRP.\n\nThe model card feels like a personal *attack* on my formatting complaints and I can respect that.\n\n"So you want a model that can do it all? You\'ve been dying to RP with a superintelligence who never refuses your advances while sticking to your strange and oddly specific dialogue format? Well, look no further because BuRP is the model you need."\n\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/BuRP_7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/BuRP_7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n3) Layris (9B)\n\nThis passthrough Eris merge aimed to bring a high scoring model together with Layla-V4. It has shown to be smart and unaligned. Also a good option in this parameter size for our use case.\n\n  - Model: [ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/Layris_9B/)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Layris_9B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n4) Infinitely-Laydiculous (7B)\n\nI really like InfinityRP\'s style, and wanted to see it merged with Layla-V4 for her absolute unhingedness/unalignment.\n\n  - Model: [Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B](https://huggingface.co/Nitral-AI/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Infinitely-Laydiculous-7B-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n5) Kunoichi-DPO-v2 (7B)\n\nGreat all around choice. Widely recommended by many users. Punches above what you\'d expect.\n\n  - Model: [SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B](https://huggingface.co/SanjiWatsuki/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B)\n  - Quants: [Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix](https://huggingface.co/Lewdiculous/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF-Imatrix)\n\n---\n\n6) Layla-V4 (7B)\n\nThis model has been stripped out of all refusals.

Yet they can all generate a single hexagon.  So first I asked Claude Instant to give me the code for drawing a single hexagon, and then I asked him how to emulate FORTH's functionality in Python, where functions are associated with numbers, and can therefore be grouped together to form new composite functions.  Armed with those two pieces of information, I was able, with some more research on the Python Turtle API, to write code to generate a recursive hexagonal grid; that is, a grid of small hexagons, which in turn form one larger hexagon.\n\nThe reason why language models are so good at code boilerplate/include statements, is because boilerplate and include statements are the two most frequently occurring elements of programming languages, within the models' training data.  They are not good at generating hexagonal grids, because most normal humans are not like me, and are not morbidly obsessed with hexagons.  In code terms, a language model is a template generator.  It can't solve problems itself, because it does not think.  It just regurgitates pre-written examples from its' training data, and assembles them together based on the sequence that exists within its' training data.\n\n>A couple times it needlessly complicated the code\n\nLanguage models can not preserve state.  So it is very important to ask it to perform multiple tasks within the same operation, as infrequently as possible.  You are better off first asking it to ***identify*** a required series of steps in order to solve your current problem.  They are usually surprisingly good at that.  Once you have that list, go to the next layer of recursion, and ask for a series of steps to achieve that particular milestone.  Then, if necessary, recurse again, and repeat.  Recursion beyond around five levels, however, should generally be avoided, if possible.  It has an unfortunate tendency to cause intense, migraine induced vomiting, and psychotic breakdowns.", 'What is the tests? Is that prompt works?
